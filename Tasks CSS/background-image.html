    <h1>Travel</h1>
    <p>Similarly, people who travel for fun get to experience and indulge in refreshing things which may serve as a stress reducer in their lives
        <br>
        There are numerous benefits to travelling if we think about it. The first one being, we get to meet new people. When you meet new people, you get the opportunity to make new friends.<br>
        Similar to this benefit, travelling makes it easier to understand people. You will learn how other people eat, speak, live and more<br>
        Another important factor which we learn when we travel is learning new skills. When you go to hilly areas, you will most likely trek and thus, trekking will be a new skill added to your list.<br>
        All in all, it is no less than a blessing to be able to travel. Many people are not privileged enough to do that.<br>
